AeroCtl Latest in Install: 0.2.5

This is a Install file for AeroCtl and the dll that it needs to work.
The dll is taken from SysWOW64 after it's made by CC.
I recently found out that for each Laptop model it's a different dll so i'll add the dlls i encounter as a choice during install.
If your laptop is not yet in the Install get in touch with me and use Setup.bat in the Install Folder to get it in system32.

All help is welcomed as this is my first project and i'm learning everything from the code to github.

To Do List:
- Add Color Profiles from the CC and SM install files.
- Update all the time with the latest AeroCtl.
- Take all feedback into consideration regarding different models and their needs.

Thank you.
