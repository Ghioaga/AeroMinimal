AeroCtl Latest in Install: 0.3.0

This is a Install file for AeroCtl and the dll that it needs to work.

The dlls are taken from the CC or SM install files.

Tested on Windows 11 and 10.

Tested on Aero 15XC and Aero 15W8.

If something doesn't work get in touch with me on Reddit.

Or I'm also on Discord as Ghioaga#7431 .

To Do List:
- Add Color Profiles from the CC and SM install files.
- Update all the time with the latest AeroCtl.
- Take all feedback into consideration regarding different models and their needs.

Thank you.
