This was made by u/Ghioaga from Reddit by taking a dll from ControlCenter app and folowing the instructions from
https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/wmi/wmiacpi#installation

AeroCtl is made by wtwrp from GitLab and for updates look on
https://gitlab.com/wtwrp/aeroctl/-/releases

Current version is 0.2.3 (Date:13.09.2021)

If your Laptop model is not in the list, get your acpimof.dll from Windows/SysWOW64 while CC is installed and save it.
Uninstall CC. Copy the dll in the install folder of AeroMinimal and run the Setup.bat. After a restart it should work.
If you want you can contact me over on Reddit so I can add your laptop model to the Setup.

For any problems you encounter please get in touch with me on Reddit.
This is my first try at an installer and I made it mostly for myself.

Thank you!

Everything should install in ProgramFiles(x86)
And the batch file should give no errors. Godspeed.
